		<h2>Get to know me!</h2>


		<p> If you asked my peers about me, they would probably say that I am positive, resourceful, and determined. I was a young mother and was so proud when I finished college.  I wanted to be a teacher.  However, the cruel brutality of children was too much for my peaceful way of life.  If you have someone in your life that is a teacher, give them a hug, they need it!</p>

		<p2> I dipped my toes in a few different professions after that, trying to find career paths that interested me.  In the meantime, I practiced my graphic design, which I studied in college as well.  Most importantly, I helped a significant other build a business and website that you can view <a href="https://512atx.com/" target="_blank">here!</a> I also worked heavily on a site called Down To Fest.  The site is currently down but you can still view the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dtf.downtofest/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a>  For the past year, I have been working on my own site, <a href="https://www.discothreads.com/" target="_blank">DiscoThreads</a> and it has been my baby ever since. </p2>

		<p3> When I heard about this bootcamp, I knew immediately that it would help to expand my personal endeavors.  I would love to be a part of a successful company, but I would like to create a company and help others achieve success as well.  </p3>
